    "   - Data structures are specialized formats used to organize, store, and manage data efficiently in a programming        language like Python. They are important because they allow us to access and manipulate data in an organized         way, which improves the performance and readability of our code. By using appropriate data structures, we can        process data more effectively, extract meaningful insights, and solve complex problems more efficiently."
